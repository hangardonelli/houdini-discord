# houdini-discord
A Houdini administration utility for Discord
###### Allowing you to manage, ban players, obtain information from the servers for CPPS with houdini-asyncio!

At this time, although the application is functional and usable without problems, there are some issues to close.
 1. Change flat queries to parameterized queries
 2. Fully translate the code into English
 3. Add more administration commands

###### Why?
Currently, I know that there are other similar tools but that they need to be installed as houdini modules or plugins, so their modification entails restarting the cpps and the obligation to write them in Python


##### Features
 - âœ… 5 min configuration!
 - âœ… Its not a houdini plugin
 - âœ… Easy to modify ðŸ’ª
 - âœ… Uses Discord server roles as privileges 
 - âœ… Commands Like ban, add items, coins, furnitures, playercard info, online players in a server and more!
